== README

Well...this project was supposed to be a joke. On the Free Code Camp for Atlanta FB page I found a link to a free Udemy Rails course. I decided to give it a go and at first thought it was pretty basic. However, in going through this first project with the course, I have found that it is actually pretty good. The first thing that I enjoy is that the instructor does not scaffold. The second is that he uses HAML.

The following GEMS are used:
devise, simple_form, haml

Project is done but may or may not post it to Heroku.
